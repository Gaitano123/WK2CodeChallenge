# **`WEEK TWO CODE CHALLENGE`**

## **`INTRODUCTION`**
In this code challenge I was working on Flataculties, this is a programm which allows the user to vote for the cutest animal!

I used a local API and build out the frontend for our app, Flataculties. The files I used for the program are
* index.html
* style.css
* index.js

---

## **`DESCRIPTION`**
There are a couple of characters, animals to be precise, which the user can be able to vote for. All the datails of the characters are well illustrated, some of the details are;
* Name of the character
* A photo of the character
* ID of the character
* The number of votes of the character

The user decides on which character they can vote for and once they vote the initial number of the vote is added by one. There is a form there which allows the user to enter new characters and filling in all their details.

## **`PROJECT SETUP`**
Since the work is already deployed on github there will be no need of forking the work, only the link will be needed to access the work. Once the link is available to the user then their work will just be to vote or add any other caracter of their interest, but that can only be viewed by themselves.
